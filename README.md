# In the first part<br>
This project fetches the 2 given inputs from Twitter. Then it saves all tweets in 2 files. <br>
Perform sentiment analysis on Twitter. <br>
Generate the Pie-Chart and Bar-Chart according to the sentiment.
Compare the result of both inputs.<br>

# In the second part<br>
It uses the Random Forest model for Text classification. This model is trained on the BBC NEWS dataset that I mentioned to download before all the process.<br>

# Prerequisite:-<br>
pip install matplotlib
pip install textblob

# How to run the code ?<br>
Make developer account on Twitter. This process can take several days, because Twitter team will do background checking on you.<br>
Build application on your developer account.<br>
Create keys that you need for this project.<br>
These keys are :- Consumer key, consumer secret key, access token and access token secret.<br>
These are highly secretive keys, so do not share it with anyone<br>
Replace below part in code with your keys :-<br>
consumer_key = 'your key'<br>
consumer_key_secret = 'your key'<br>
access_token = 'your key'<br>
access_token_secret = 'your key'<br>
<br>
Check the directories properly.

# Feel free to use the code
